            <div class="header">Brief</div>
            <div class="body-copy mt-2 mb-14">Pixlmob runs a marketplace connecting real estate media companies with professional editors. However, the traditional marketplace setup posed challenges for large companies with extensive post-production needs. To overcome these challenges, Pixlmob introduced Post House, a concierge service that bypasses the limitations of a marketplace by offering personalized, high-touch solutions. Post House is designed to cater to the specific needs of high-volume real estate media companies, providing a streamlined and efficient service that aligns perfectly with their business goals.</div>

            <div class="header">Market Research</div>
            <div class="body-copy mt-2 mb-14">To ensure Post House would stand out in the competitive market, extensive research was conducted. This included exploring competitors in real estate photography post-production through platforms like Reddit and Facebook groups, where industry professionals often share recommendations. For each competitor identified, detailed information was collected, including logos, color schemes, typefaces, icons, graphics, websites, photography styles, visual identifiers, taglines, value propositions, key messages, differentiation, positioning, and services offered. Additionally, a thorough audit was conducted on virtual assistant companies, as Post Houseâ€™s service elements closely resemble those of a concierge service. The research also extended to brands that influence Post House's target audience, such as camera and gear brands, to ensure that every aspect of the Post House brand resonated with its intended market.</div>

            <div class="header">Strategic Brief</div>
            <div class="body-copy mt-2 mb-14">The comprehensive market research informed the development of a strategic brief that laid the foundation for the Post House brand. The strategic brief included detailed insights into brand attributes, positioning, value propositions, competitive advantages, differentiation, brand essence, key messaging, tone of voice, brand spectrums, the big idea, core values, and a SWOT analysis of Post House. This strategic framework guided the creation of a brand that is not only distinct but also strategically positioned to meet the needs of its target audience. The brief also outlined a marketing strategy that would effectively communicate Post House's unique value proposition to prospective clients.</div>

            <div class="header">Visual Directions</div>
            <div class="body-copy mt-2 mb-14">Three distinct visual directions were developed based on the strategic brief:
              <li>Refined Metrics: This direction emphasized a clean, mathematical aesthetic that conveys simplicity and class, reflecting the precision and professionalism of Post House.</li>
              <li>Data Nostalgia: Inspired by vintage technology, this direction blended nostalgia with a futuristic touch, creating a unique visual language that resonated with the history and future of technology.</li>
              <li>Metallic World: This direction focused on a sleek, modern aesthetic inspired by chrome and liquid mercury, symbolizing the fluidity and cutting-edge nature of Post House's services.</li>

            <div class="header">Final Visual Direction</div>
            <div class="body-copy mt-2 mb-14">After careful consideration, the client chose the "Refined Metrics" direction but requested that elements from the "Metallic World" direction, specifically the visual of connecting dots, be incorporated. To meet this request, illustrations were created using fluid orbs with a dithering effect, merging the clean, mathematical precision of "Refined Metrics" with the dynamic, interconnected visuals of "Metallic World." This combination resulted in a unique and visually compelling brand identity that effectively communicates the Post House ethos.</div>

This included an introduction to the brand, its foundational principles, visual identity, and usage guidelines. The brand book detailed the correct application of logos, color schemes, typography, and illustrations, ensuring consistency across all touchpoints.
